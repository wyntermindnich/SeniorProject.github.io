		<h2> Abstract </h2> 
		<p>
For my senior capstone project, I built a website to be used as an educational resource. Now in the era of covid this project's relevance 
			is present more than ever, due to our new style of living and learning through online schooling. My goal was to create a 
			product that lessens the gap between education and technology. This website highlights an overview of basic computer science concepts 
			with a quiz at the end, as an interactive feature and self evaluation.. This website is an educational tool to be used by anyone 
			interested in basic computer science concepts. This website is built using HTML and styled with CSS.  There are multiple pages for 
			the user to tab through, information, and a quiz. This website took a lot of trial and error, the final product delivered simple and 
			concise information for its user.
