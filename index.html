			For my senior capstone project, I will be building an interactive website that will be an educational tool for 
			basic computer science concepts. This project's relevance coincides with now living in the COVID-19 era. Around 
			the world people are online more than ever, a large sector of that population being students and educators. This 
			transition has been challenging, the resources are uneven, creating wider education gaps. My project concept is 
			to build a tool that makes that learning gap smaller. I will be building an HTML website with an interactive 
			terminal that can execute basic code statements. To build this terminal I will be using a web widget of a kernel 
			from a Jupyter notebook. For example a simple print statement or arithmetic problem. This interactive terminal is 
			what bridges the gap between learning a coding concept and being able to apply it instantly. A terminal on the 
			website is important for learning because it allows people who are maybe curious about computer science to implore 
			more than just reading an article or watching a video. The instant interactive component of a learning platform 
			bridges the gap between people who have never seen code in action to novice to full-time computer science students. 
			The goal of this project is to make code feel like it is easily accessible to any user.
